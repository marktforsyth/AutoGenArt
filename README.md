## Auto Generated Art
 
This is a fun little project using HTML canvas and JavaScript where I test out some different autogenerated art ideas! Each function is a different art project.
 
Some of the projects simply use basic randomness, while others use Calculus concepts of derivatives and higher-order derivatives! This was a great opportunity to apply my math skills into code in a visually interesting way.
